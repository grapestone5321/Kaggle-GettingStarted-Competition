**This is a Code Competition**

Submissions to this competition must be made by an output from a Kaggle Notebook/Script.

- Notebook run-time per session capped at 2 hours.
- CPU, GPU, or TPU all allowed.
- The submission file must contain predictions for the test set, following the format of the sample_submission.csv file on the Data Page. The submission file notebook output must be named submission.csv.
- Your code will not be re-run, as there is no completely hidden test set.

## Kaggle-GettingStarted-Simulation-Competition

## 10. Connect X
Connect your checkers in a row before your opponent!



**We’re excited to announce a beta-version of a brand-new type of ML competition called Simulations. In Simulation Competitions, you’ll compete against a set of rules, rather than against an evaluation metric. To enter, accept the rules and create a python submission file that can “play” against a computer, or another user.**
