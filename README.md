**We’re excited to announce a beta-version of a brand-new type of ML competition called Simulations. In Simulation Competitions, you’ll compete against a set of rules, rather than against an evaluation metric. To enter, accept the rules and create a python submission file that can “play” against a computer, or another user.**
